# ReactMovieDataBase
Simple client side application featuring React and components, just for fun 

It requires an API Key from https://www.themoviedb.org, I suggest you go there now and get yourself a key for it  :)

In addition it uses the free credits form Azure DevOps to trigger builds from a CI environment configured based on pushes to Main branch, it does also trigger releases based on successful builds using the same pipelines for Release and it deploys this app as a static website in Azure Storage
